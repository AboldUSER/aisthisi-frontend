            "question": "How can I let you know I'm interested in collaborating?",
            "answer": "Reach out to us on our Twitter or our Discord! We have much more info to share with those interested!"
        },
        {
            "question": "Overall, what is expected of an artist?",
            "answer": "Design an art piece that will be used as a label for the bottle of olive oil, and either the same or similar digital piece to be included with the NFT."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is there a specific theme or art medium for the artist?",
            "answer": "We hope that each artist will come with their unique style, background and speciality to find inspiration in this unique type of project. You are not limited to creating pieces about olives or oil. Although the labels are static images, the digital pieces can be as dynamic as you want!"
        },
        {
            "question": "When are these NFTs and bottles of olive oil expected to drop?",
            "answer": "The olive oil harvest takes place in October 2021, and bottles will be shipped by end of that month. The auction will take place ten weeks preceding October 1st, 2021. The first NFT auction will be held on July 23rd, 2021. Every week another artists' NFT will be listed for auction."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is there a deadline for providing art?",
            "answer": "The digital art piece as well as the physical label design must be finished by the beginning of July 2021. "
        },
        {
            "question": "How will proceeds from the NFT auctions be shared?",
            "answer": "Proceeds will be split three ways - 1/3 going to the artist and 1/3 each going to the two technical team members."
        },
        {
            "question": "Will costs impact the proceeds to the artist?",
            "answer": "No. As the costs incurred are not estimated to be much, we have decided that they will just come out of the share by the two technical team members. Hence the artist will get the full 1/3 portion of whatever the NFT is auctioned for."
        },
        
        {
            "question": "Are royalties included back to artists if the NFT is sold again?",
            "answer": "As NFT marketplaces generally pay out royalties directly to the minter’s address in a consolidated manner (i.e., conduct payouts weekly/monthly), we are tracking royalties manually and these royalties are subject to the same revenue share as the auction revenue (33%) and will be paid out monthly. There will be a minimum threshold to be reached of $50 to account for current gas fees."
        },
        {
            "question": "What about doing multiple bottles of each artists’ design?",
            "answer": "We only have at most 14 liters or 28 500ml bottles of olive oil (if we end up with 100% throughput and neglect any buffer). We are conducting a hand harvesting operation (e.g., no industrial tools) and can logistically only harvest at most 100kg of olives (~14 liters of oil), without hiring more help. As these are 500ml bottles, there would only be enough for the 10 bottles auctioned and provide each artist with a bottle. Since this is a traditional, hand harvesting process and operation, it is not very feasible to do much more. That is also why these are so rare!"
        },
        {
            "question": "Can artists get a bottle of olive oil?",
            "answer": "Yes! Each artist will get a bottle of delicious, traditional olive oil shipped to them if needed! This will not include NFT work or signatures, only the oil itself."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can I get more information on this delicious traditional olive oil?",
            "answer": "It’s called “Omphakinon”, and it is a traditional recipe that uses olives before they mature, when they are still unripe and green. The olives are harvested early in mid-October, picked from the trees by hand and processed within 24 hours."
